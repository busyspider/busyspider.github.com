<p>This is the first weekend of Montessori Blocks. In order to have more kids have opportunities to play with this awesome game, Montessori Blocks is limited time free during this weekend. This morning I received an email from Lisa McCormackï¼Œthe wonderful lady working for smartappsforkids.com. And got known that Montessori Blocks is just featured on #1 kids app review website: <a alt="smartappsforkids.com" href="http://www.smartappsforkids.com/2013/05/free-app-friday.html">smartappsforkids.com</a>.  </p>
