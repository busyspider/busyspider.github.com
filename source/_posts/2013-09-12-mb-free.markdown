<p> Busyspider Mobile just released a free version for its first apps Montessori Blocks. This free version has a couple of free levels playing for the trial of the player. In this way we believe that  more kids can test it out before the parents would like to spend $0.99 on it.

<p>Price:  Free</p>
<p>Platform: iPad</p>
