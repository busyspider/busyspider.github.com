</ul>

<ul >
<li>  MONTESSORI BLOCKS is a very simple, interesting, and educational block game. </li>

<li>  The playing rules are very straightforward. The player needs to choose one block
from five colors and move it to the right board. As long as the right
pattern is the same as the left model, the pattern player is successful.</li>

<li>  It is designed for kids from 2-10 years old.</li>

</ul>

<h2>WHY MONTESSORI?</h2>
<ul>
<li> MONTESSORI BLOCKS is a Montessori based educational game. In the Montessori classroom the kids are always encouraged to LEARN BY DOING which requires the spontaneous investigation and practice.  By playing MONTESSORI BLOCKS the kids will naturally abstract the information of color, quantity and direction from the model pattern and the abstracted information will instruct them to move the blocks and form their own pattern. It is exactly the process of LEARNING BY DOING.  </li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>A good experiment for number and colors. Kids need to apply their knowledge of number, color, and shape spontaneously in their playing. This process will help them to strengthen the concept deeply and personally. </li>
<li>Very simple rules, and broad spans of difficulties, good for kids from 2 years to 10 years old. 
<li>By locating the position through quantity and direction in a two-dimensional space, young players can set up the very basic concept of coordinate. </li>
 
<li>Learn the name of the objects, alphabets, and numbers. </li>
<li>A great coordination practice of hands, brain, and eyes. </li>
</ul>
</li>
