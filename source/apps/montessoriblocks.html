<h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>

Montessori Blocks is a very simple fun game, from which, kids can get a combine training in a couple of areas. First the kids need to observe the model pattern, during this process, they need to figure out the color, position, number.

It helps children to build up concept of color, number , pattern and how to locate a two dimension position. 
The abstract concept ( like number）is setup gradually through the fun image activities.
